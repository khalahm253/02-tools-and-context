This a module that focuses on making methods, that match the built array methods that we are so used to, from scratch.

This list module includes array methods such as push(), pop(), shift(), , forEach(), map(), .

In this module, I utilize Test Driven Development to make sure our module operated as expected and I integrated with Travis to verify successful builds as I deploy to GitHub.


  


## Testing

  * tests that ensure the list module functions correctly with error-check parameters
  * tests that the correct errors are thrown with invalid arguments exist
  * tests to ensure that the list module functions return the correct results when invoked with valid arguments
